# QuestionGenerator
This repository facilitates the fine-tuning of a Language Model (LLM) using a dataset of Question-Answer pairs. Users can upload a PDF containing domain-specific material, and the application will transform it into a question-answer dataset. The conversion is performed with the assistance of an offline Mistral 7B model, which can be replaced with a preferred LLM of choice. The output is then formatted into a .csv file for further use.
